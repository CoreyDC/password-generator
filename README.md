# Password Generator

## Description 

This webpage contains HTML, CSS and javascript. I built this application so people can generate random passwords that nobody will ever guess! The main things I learned to use while building this page was how to utilize different javascript methods, how to concatenate arrays and how to utilize loops.  

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The page has a text area in the center with a generate password button. If you click the button it will take you through a series of confirmations and prompts. You will be asked to choose how long you would like your password, and if you would like to include letters, numbers, special characters and/or capital letters. After you chose how you want your random password configured, it will pop up in random sequence in the text area. If you like the sequence you can copy and save it -- if not refresh the page and try again.
